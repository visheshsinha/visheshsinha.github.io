### What are NFTs?

NFT stands for non-fungible token. What non-fungibility means is it cannot be replaced with another token. Unlike fungible tokens (ZRX, SNT, EOS, etc.) NFTs can have different values and have their own unique identity. A limited-edition card is a good example of something non-fungible, each card is treated as a collectible, is unique, and has its own value and if you trade it for some other card, you'll have something totally different. On the other hand, let's say you have a banknote and you replace it with another banknote of the same value, you'll have exactly the same thing.

NFTs prove ownership of digital assets in the same way that people own crypto coins (Fungible tokens). NFTs are powered by smart contracts that govern how the asset works. 

### Blockchain standards - ERC721

Non Fungible tokens on ethereum work on ERC721 standards whereas fungible tokens work on ERC20 standards. There is a critical difference between ERC20 and ERC271 tokens, while an ERC20 token represents a single type of asset, an ERC721 token represents a class of assets. There a d

These standards implement the interface that a token must have to be sent and received between wallets or traded on a cryptocurrency exchange. A standard is simply a template(a bunch of functions) or format that other developers agree to follow. It makes writing code easier and reusable. These standards make a token compatible with various applications including wallet, exchange, and dapps.

### A brief history

September 2017 - The initial ERC721 specification was proposed by Dieter Shirley as an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP).

December 2017 - A beta version of a decentralized application was introduced called CryptoKitty. It's a collectible game where people can buy digital cats and breed new ones. Each cat on the application is a unique token and has its own value. The application was launched before the standards were finalized. It has gained a lot of popularity since then and has caused Ethereum blockchain to slow down significantly.

June 2018 - ERC721 standards were finalized after a strong consensus among ethereum developers.

A lot of creative applications have been developed in the past couple of years where people can buy and sell digital assets using NFTs.

### How NFTs are different from cryptocurrency?

There's no doubt both NFTs and cryptocurrency (Fungible tokens) are governed by smart contracts on the blockchain. The fundamental difference between Non-fungible tokens and fungible tokes is NFTs represent digital assets, are unique and interchangeable whereas cryptocurrencies are fungible because of their capability of interchangeability. For example, if you own an Ethereum ZRX token, it can be replaced with another ZRX token and it will be good for the same value. NFTs do not have any inherent value, they derive their value from the digital asset they represent.

### How do NFTs Work?

NFTs, like fungible tokens, reside on the blockchain. Essentially, NFTs are like digital collector’s items. So instead of getting an actual asset, the buyer gets a digital file instead. You must be thinking there could be copies of the digital file on the internet. But NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: Each token minted is unique and has an owner and this information is easily verifiable since it is on the blockchain. To put it in terms of physical assets: anyone can buy a Monet print. But only one person can own the original. The token proves that your copy of a digital file is the original, like owning an original painting.

The content creator’s public crypto key serves as proof of ownership for that particular digital artifact. The pair of the creator’s public key and the owner’s private key is what determines the value of any NFT token. When you pay for an NFT, what you get is the right to transfer the token to your digital wallet.

### Uses of NFTs

There are several potential use cases of NFTs for both creators and collectors. There have also been some attempts to connect NFTs to real-world objects often as a sort of verification method. Some of the most notable use cases of NFTs are mentioned below:

Digital content (artwork, music, videos, etc.)
Gaming assets
Domain names
Collectables
Fashion

### How to buy NFTs?

Make sure you have your wallet set up and funded, There are several marketplaces that have popped up around NFTs, which allow people to buy and sell. Currently, the largest NFT marketplaces are OpenSea, Rarible, and Grimes’ choice, Nifty Gateway. There are plenty of others. Although these platforms and others are hosts to thousands of creators and collectors, be sure you do your research carefully before buying. 

In addition, the verification processes for creators and NFT listings aren’t consistent across platforms — some of them have more strict regulations than others.
